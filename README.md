# CryptoSuggester Frontend

This is the Frontend for my CrypoSuggester project. This project fetches prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum from the backend. Then displays it in smallcards on a webpage which also will recommend where to buy and where to sell. I made this project for an interview assignment for Chainalysis. 

## What I learned
* Next.js with Tailwind CSS
* React
* Fetching data from the backend
* JS fundamentals

## Usage
Make sure the backend is running before you run the frontend\
Open terminal and type these commands
```bash
cd CryptoSuggester-Frontend-main
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open brower and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
